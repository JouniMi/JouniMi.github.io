<p class="">Hello all!</p>

<div>
<p class="">My name is Jouni Mikkola, a security inspired fellow from Finland. This blog will be hosting mainly Threat Hunting, Threat Intelligence and Incident response related topics. It started as a threat hunting blog thus the name but since then I have been exploring other topics so I decided to change this page.</p>
<p class="">I have been working in Cybersecurity for over 5 years. All the time that I have been in the field I have worked within the blue team - mainly DFIR and Threat Hunting. I have had some assignments in SOC too, although my experience isn't that extensive in the SOC roles. Most of my time has been within a Finnish Cybersecurity company known as Nixu- however I joined Deloitte as a manager - responsible for DFIR &amp; TH related tasks. My stay at Deloitte was a little short and now I am at Accenture, being responsible for the DFIR business within the Nordics. I have been in IT for almost 20 years, the first 10 I spent with consulting Microsoft related server products - like Office 365, Exchange, OCS-Lync-Skpe, ADFS, AD and many others.</p>
<p class="">After moving towards the DFIR world I have also been conducting quite a lot of threat hunts. Most of my experience is from host/endpoint based threat hunting, usually revolving around EDR technologies, with some additions from the SIEMâ€™s. My personal opinion is, that host based data is the best data when it comes to threat hunting also I do also appreciate the possibilities that network based threat hunting can open. I have been moving more to a leadership position but I still have a place in my heart for all things technical. Now during my work I might be more about excel and PowerPoint but the blog is a great place to tinker with technical side of things too.</p>
<p class="">There will be no scheduled updates to the blog and it will be worked on when time allows. Now that I have been doing this for a while, it seems that my time and ideas varies a lot.</p>
